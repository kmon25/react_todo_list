# React Todo List

This is a simple and elegant React todo list built to practice react concepts.<br>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project also uses a custom built API server and MongoDB to save your todos.<br> `The server is hosted on Heroku and the database is hosted on mLab`
